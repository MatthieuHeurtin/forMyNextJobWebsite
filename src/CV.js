     <h3>Profil</h3>
Young, dynamic and curious, I have a strong interest in programming and more specifically in 
architecture and design. I’m not afraid of hard work as long as I’m learning.
I try to always see what I’m doing from a user point of view. I like when the software/process is 
“so simple that it can’t crash”.
I see myself as someone who needs to keep learning to be able, one day, to be in charge of a whole 
project.

I’m currently working as a support on a front office application called Fast. Fast is mainly developed in Java and it is used by hundreds traders. It allows them to see their positions, their greeks, to book new contracts and more generally to manage their books. On a daily basis I have to fix any problem that may occur, if the problem comes from Fast, or find an easy and quick workaround if the problem comes from another application. When everything is working, I implement new features that have been asked or I improve the ones already existing.
My current position requires me to find good and stable solutions as fast as possible, but also to keep a good level of communication to secure the traders and to make the link between the FO, MO and others application fast depends on.
