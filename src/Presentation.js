<h5>My current situation:</h5> I’m currently working as a support on several front office applications.
On a daily basis I have to fix any problems that may occur, if the problem comes from one of my 
applications, or find an easy and quick workaround if the problem comes from another application. 

When everything is working, I implement new features that have been asked or I improve the ones 
already existing.
My current position requires me to find good and stable solutions as fast as possible, but also to
 keep a good level of communication to secure the traders and to make the link between the FO, MO 
 and others application my applications depend on.
<h5>Why do I want to leave::</h5> Due to a new organization, several applications that I used to support 
are now developed by some dedicated teams. Every time a problem occur, I have to ask them to fix the 
problem. I’m having less and less impact on the applications. I’m just the link between traders and 
developer teams.

<h5>What I’m looking for:</h5> I would like to work as a front office developer, I want to keep the contact with the traders, having a rapid feedback on what I’m developing is essential for me. I also would like to focus on one major application in order to have more impact on the traders and having more challenging features to implement. From a technology point of view : C#, WPF,SQL, ReactJS are the technology i'm the most efficient.
